(** Lexical tokens.  Every token carries the position of its first

    and kan-lang-tot-pin/surface/loc.ml:1-17 for the position type,
    which rides in this file because the M0 surface has no loc.ml of its
    own.  SA-D2 keeps every position out of the surface tree, so a
    position lives in the token list and in the error the parser
    returns, nowhere else. *)

    grammar reads it as one form.  [Dot1] and [Dot2] are the pair
    projections and [Dot] with a following [Nat] is the collection
    projection (SA-D16).  [KSum] and [KProd] are the two collection type
    words that Stage B adds (SB-D1).  [KMu] and [KNu] are reserved: the parser
    refuses both with their milestone name (SA-D3). *)
